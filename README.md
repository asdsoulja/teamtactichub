Abstract

We develop an implementation of the classic game “tic-tac-toe”, played against an AI. 
A 3x3 board will be presented to the player, who makes moves on the board by clicking on the desired cell of the board. 
The AI responds with its own move, and the game continues as expected. When either the AI or the Player wins, a message will pop up on the screen declaring the results of the game.
Ideally, we would have an appealing design for the board and the background. This would make playing the game a more pleasurable experience.
